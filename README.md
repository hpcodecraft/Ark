# Ark

Ark is a microblogging and visual bookmarking tool.

It features a public page which shows your bookmarks/posts like a microblog. The logged in part on the other hand is a visual bookmarking page heavily inspired by [Zootool](http://zootool.com).

Originally a fork of [Asaph](https://github.com/phoboslab/Asaph).
